# Spell checking web application

### Buit with Flask!

This project is for my application security course at NYU
The project is to extend off an earlier project where we built a 
spell checking application in C and used CI and fuzzing tools to automate
testing and vulnarability identification. 

#### Goals
- Build a secure application while learing the basics of web development
- Working on building a test suite with high coverage.
- Conduct thorough penetration testing of the application
- Focus on the look of the application only after functionality has been tested and verified secure.
